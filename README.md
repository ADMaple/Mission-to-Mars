# Mission-to-Mars

Robin is a Junior Data Scientist who does freelance astronomy work and hopes to work for NASA someday. She is currently fascinated with Mars and spends time researching articles online. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. For this project, I've helped Robin code a web scraper that puts together Mars data from several different sites.

Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components

## Webpage Overview
The webpage is only local and the direct link can't be shared. I've included a preview below. The changes added were some custom CSS, adding the images, in addition to the standard Bootstrap layout and swiped a google font, and a Mars background image from the Mars NASA site.bEach time the button is clicked the sites are scraped again and the page reloads with new info. Robin's web app is looking good and functioning well, after I added more polish to it.
